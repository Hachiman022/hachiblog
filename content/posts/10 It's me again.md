It feels good to have a close friend again, to talk with people and connect with their dreams and emotions. I think that’s the difference of being an INFJ—you truly feel and empathize with others and understand what they’re going through. You can help them open up and discuss the real problems they’re facing. I love helping people look forward to better things. I feel happy when I see that I’ve inspired or encouraged them to become better. I’m sharing this because I recently talked with some new friends at the office, and I got to know them better. I could feel that they, too, struggle like I do, and I always want to motivate people when I sense I can help. Haha. Thank you again for today. Please continue to fight, and together we will change our future.
