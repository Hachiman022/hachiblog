Hi, it's me again, you from the future, the one who is going to read this. I hope this marks the day that we surrender everything to Him. We can't do it by ourselves; we've already proved that. Anyway, today is a happy day, and I need to be thankful for that as I want to practice gratitude. This will help us become content with everything. By the way, our phone is totally broken now, hahaha. Even when I charge it, it won't turn on. But yeah, we still need to be thankful for everything. Hope you're doing fine there. As of the moment, we are doing OK. We can do this.
