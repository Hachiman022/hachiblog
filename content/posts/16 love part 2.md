Hey, it’s me, the first user who wrote about 'I want to write something about love based on my experience.' I’ve read a few people opening up the discussion, and it’s good. To the writer who mentioned they are 17 years old: don’t worry, you’re still young. You will understand the answer someday. Life will unwrap itself, no matter what happens, so be ready when it does. You may say love is cruel, but love is also an essential emotion. It’s something everyone must experience — to be loved and to love. Once you experience it, it’s up to you whether to pursue it. But like I said, everything is a commitment, a decision. So no matter what happens, don’t commit to someone unless you’re ready to sacrifice yourself.

To the other person who wrote about cheating: yes, cheating is a choice, but so is forgiving. Always remember that we do not own people. It’s better to let them go than to push them to love us. I’ve experienced cheating, by the way — twice, to be exact. Someone might tell me I’m naive, asking why I let them, but like I said, this is my opinion. Love is a commitment, so I’ve tried to understand them again. But when you no longer remain committed to yourself, that’s when you realize it’s okay to let go and let them be happy. Every person has a choice, and we cannot control it.

Also, in life, don’t try to control things that are out of your control, or you’ll never find peace.

Thank you.
