Good morning! It's Sunday, and we are currently at a stable stage. Hehe, I enjoyed the whole day of resting yesterday. We watched a movie and ate food. I hope it stays like this always. Anyways, it's another day, and I'm writing this at 4:48 AM. I watched two moviesâ€”_Black Widow_ and _Hawkeye_, which is a series. I fell asleep while watching, but I finished it. It's a nice movie, and it teaches you that no matter what happens or what decisions you've made in the past, you can move forward and continue. I hope you're doing well there, and let's thank him for another day.
