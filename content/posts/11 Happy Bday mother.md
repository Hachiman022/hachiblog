Happy Birthday, Ma. It's been 7 years since you left. Life is quite hard, really—too many struggles going on here, but I hope Papa and you are happy there. Just watch over me this year. I promise to look back on this journal at the end of the year to reflect. I will make sure that this year will be different. Happy birthday again, Mama. Today is my day off from work, and I'm planning to visit you later, I hope. If not, maybe on Sunday. I'll also try to update my resume, just in case. Anyway, let's make the most of today and make it productive!

Earlier, I missed the dogs—you know, Bella and Dos. If I hadn't messed up last year, they'd still be with me. But like the quote from _Arcane_ says, '#Sometimes taking a leap forward means leaving a few things behind.' Maybe that's how life should be since everything here is temporary. We already know that, haha. Be kind, okay? Stay positive—good days will come as long as you choose to move forward. Thank you.
