The reason why I was not able to blog these past few days is because I was sick for a week. I also skipped work for at least three days. After a long time, this is the first time I've had the flu, and I don't really like it, hahaha. By the way, I want to appreciate that we are able to stop, not totally, but itâ€™s a small win in our fight against addiction. I know you know that the next step is to move towards your goal. Also, think of this: there is no perfect timing. The perfect timing is now. Okay, let's go and make 2025 a great year ahead. Thank you! I believe in you.
