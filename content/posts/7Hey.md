Yesterday, I felt lazy to go to the office, so I worked from home. I need to change this habit since it’s not helpful for us. But you know, we need to feel stable first so we can move on to the next step. We should also get back to exercising—I'm feeling so bloated—and focus on our diet as well. Anyway, for sure we’ll get there. No pressure; take your time. Always remember to enjoy your life. And enjoyment doesn't always mean going out and partying. Sometimes, it’s about staying at home, exploring the internet, learning new things, and playing games. Like I said, we are just simple people, so don't listen to other people's definitions of happiness—it’s not you. OK? Just remember, we’re doing well. Hope to see you again tomorrow.
