"My body's on the line now.  
I can't fight this time now.  
I can feel the light shine on my face.  
Did I disappoint you?  
Will they still let me over  
If I cross the line?"

How many times did I try to cross the line? When should I learn? But I am still grateful to God that He still guides me and provides the things I need. Maybe I just need to persevere and hope for the best. I still thank You, God. Happy Birthday.
