I want to write something about love based on my experience. I've just realized, throughout my 26 years of life, that love is a commitment. I was able to distinguish this after 5 years in a past relationship. There was a time when I really wanted to stop loving someone, but since love is a commitment, you never stop loving them no matter what. From what I see, problems in relationships are always present—cheating, changes in behavior, and many more issues. However, the problem with younger people today is that they don’t always accept these flaws. Older generations were more forgiving; they would give their loved ones a chance to prove themselves again because they understood that love is a commitment. Nowadays, people recognize their worth, which is good, but I think there should be a middle ground. With social media, people feel more entitled to things that didn’t exist before, and that has made them less forgiving. I’m not sure if this is bad or good, but I do know that love should always be a choice.
