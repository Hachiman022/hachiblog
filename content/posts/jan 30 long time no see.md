Hi, I got lazy again the past few days and fell back into some bad habits, but we’re already in control of it—kudos to you. We’re on the right path right now, so just keep doing what you’re doing. Focus on the things that matter and give value to yourself. Don’t be too vulnerable; take the opportunities that come your way, but make sure to think them through. I’m proud of you, and even if it’s tough, we’re taking baby steps towards our goals. It might be hard, but we’re getting there. I believe in you, and we can do this. Heal and grow from everything we face. Help, but don’t let yourself suffer. I promise we’ll make ourselves proud one day. We’re good, and we’re going to be good.
