&lt;p&gt;Good morning! It&amp;rsquo;s Sunday, and we are currently at a stable stage. Hehe, I enjoyed the whole day of resting yesterday. We watched a movie and ate food. I hope it stays like this always. Anyways, it&amp;rsquo;s another day, and I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at 4:48 AM. I watched two movies—&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, which is a series. I fell asleep while watching, but I finished it. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice movie, and it teaches you that no matter what happens or what decisions you&amp;rsquo;ve made in the past, you can move forward and continue. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing well there, and let&amp;rsquo;s thank him for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:45 Am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unblocked someone and stalked a bit, hehe. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit strange to see someone who was once part of your life become a stranger. Haha, how did people overcome this before? Anyways, I know it&amp;rsquo;s not good to cling to your past, as it will only hinder your healing and moving forward. I hope you start prioritizing yourself, okay? Promise me that this year will be different. We will come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I felt lazy to go to the office, so I worked from home. I need to change this habit since it’s not helpful for us. But you know, we need to feel stable first so we can move on to the next step. We should also get back to exercising—I&amp;rsquo;m feeling so bloated—and focus on our diet as well. Anyway, for sure we’ll get there. No pressure; take your time. Always remember to enjoy your life. And enjoyment doesn&amp;rsquo;t always mean going out and partying. Sometimes, it’s about staying at home, exploring the internet, learning new things, and playing games. Like I said, we are just simple people, so don&amp;rsquo;t listen to other people&amp;rsquo;s definitions of happiness—it’s not you. OK? Just remember, we’re doing well. Hope to see you again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hi, it&amp;rsquo;s me again, you from the future, the one who is going to read this. I hope this marks the day that we surrender everything to Him. We can&amp;rsquo;t do it by ourselves; we&amp;rsquo;ve already proved that. Anyway, today is a happy day, and I need to be thankful for that as I want to practice gratitude. This will help us become content with everything. By the way, our phone is totally broken now, hahaha. Even when I charge it, it won&amp;rsquo;t turn on. But yeah, we still need to be thankful for everything. Hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing fine there. As of the moment, we are doing OK. We can do this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My body&amp;rsquo;s on the line now.&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t fight this time now.&lt;br&gt;
I can feel the light shine on my face.&lt;br&gt;
Did I disappoint you?&lt;br&gt;
Will they still let me over&lt;br&gt;
If I cross the line?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times did I try to cross the line? When should I learn? But I am still grateful to God that He still guides me and provides the things I need. Maybe I just need to persevere and hope for the best. I still thank You, God. Happy Birthday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
