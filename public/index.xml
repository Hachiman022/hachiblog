      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My body&amp;rsquo;s on the line now.&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t fight this time now.&lt;br&gt;
I can feel the light shine on my face.&lt;br&gt;
Did I disappoint you?&lt;br&gt;
Will they still let me over&lt;br&gt;
If I cross the line?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times did I try to cross the line? When should I learn? But I am still grateful to God that He still guides me and provides the things I need. Maybe I just need to persevere and hope for the best. I still thank You, God. Happy Birthday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
