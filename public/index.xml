      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, it’s me, the first user who wrote about &amp;lsquo;I want to write something about love based on my experience.&amp;rsquo; I’ve read a few people opening up the discussion, and it’s good. To the writer who mentioned they are 17 years old: don’t worry, you’re still young. You will understand the answer someday. Life will unwrap itself, no matter what happens, so be ready when it does. You may say love is cruel, but love is also an essential emotion. It’s something everyone must experience — to be loved and to love. Once you experience it, it’s up to you whether to pursue it. But like I said, everything is a commitment, a decision. So no matter what happens, don’t commit to someone unless you’re ready to sacrifice yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hey, it’s me, the first user who wrote about &amp;lsquo;I want to write something about love based on my experience.&amp;rsquo; I’ve read a few people opening up the discussion, and it’s good. To the writer who mentioned they are 17 years old: don’t worry, you’re still young. You will understand the answer someday. Life will unwrap itself, no matter what happens, so be ready when it does. You may say love is cruel, but love is also an essential emotion. It’s something everyone must experience — to be loved and to love. Once you experience it, it’s up to you whether to pursue it. But like I said, everything is a commitment, a decision. So no matter what happens, don’t commit to someone unless you’re ready to sacrifice yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the other person who wrote about cheating: yes, cheating is a choice, but so is forgiving. Always remember that we do not own people. It’s better to let them go than to push them to love us. I’ve experienced cheating, by the way — twice, to be exact. Someone might tell me I’m naive, asking why I let them, but like I said, this is my opinion. Love is a commitment, so I’ve tried to understand them again. But when you no longer remain committed to yourself, that’s when you realize it’s okay to let go and let them be happy. Every person has a choice, and we cannot control it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in life, don’t try to control things that are out of your control, or you’ll never find peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I was not able to blog these past few days is because I was sick for a week. I also skipped work for at least three days. After a long time, this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had the flu, and I don&amp;rsquo;t really like it, hahaha. By the way, I want to appreciate that we are able to stop, not totally, but it’s a small win in our fight against addiction. I know you know that the next step is to move towards your goal. Also, think of this: there is no perfect timing. The perfect timing is now. Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s go and make 2025 a great year ahead. Thank you! I believe in you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;iframe style=&#34;border-radius:12px&#34; src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2jHHaNZrgt506zDAKlhQr3?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;152&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to write something about love based on my experience. I&amp;rsquo;ve just realized, throughout my 26 years of life, that love is a commitment. I was able to distinguish this after 5 years in a past relationship. There was a time when I really wanted to stop loving someone, but since love is a commitment, you never stop loving them no matter what. From what I see, problems in relationships are always present—cheating, changes in behavior, and many more issues. However, the problem with younger people today is that they don’t always accept these flaws. Older generations were more forgiving; they would give their loved ones a chance to prove themselves again because they understood that love is a commitment. Nowadays, people recognize their worth, which is good, but I think there should be a middle ground. With social media, people feel more entitled to things that didn’t exist before, and that has made them less forgiving. I’m not sure if this is bad or good, but I do know that love should always be a choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I was planning on running, but when I woke up, I felt my body ache and had a slight fever. Though I still helped with some of the house chores, I think I just need some rest. Anyways, that&amp;rsquo;s all for today as we need to rest. Hope we get better tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday, Ma. It&amp;rsquo;s been 7 years since you left. Life is quite hard, really—too many struggles going on here, but I hope Papa and you are happy there. Just watch over me this year. I promise to look back on this journal at the end of the year to reflect. I will make sure that this year will be different. Happy birthday again, Mama. Today is my day off from work, and I&amp;rsquo;m planning to visit you later, I hope. If not, maybe on Sunday. I&amp;rsquo;ll also try to update my resume, just in case. Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s make the most of today and make it productive!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I missed the dogs—you know, Bella and Dos. If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t messed up last year, they&amp;rsquo;d still be with me. But like the quote from &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; says, &amp;lsquo;#Sometimes taking a leap forward means leaving a few things behind.&amp;rsquo; Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s how life should be since everything here is temporary. We already know that, haha. Be kind, okay? Stay positive—good days will come as long as you choose to move forward. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels good to have a close friend again, to talk with people and connect with their dreams and emotions. I think that’s the difference of being an INFJ—you truly feel and empathize with others and understand what they’re going through. You can help them open up and discuss the real problems they’re facing. I love helping people look forward to better things. I feel happy when I see that I’ve inspired or encouraged them to become better. I’m sharing this because I recently talked with some new friends at the office, and I got to know them better. I could feel that they, too, struggle like I do, and I always want to motivate people when I sense I can help. Haha. Thank you again for today. Please continue to fight, and together we will change our future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hi, good morning! This is the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve celebrated the New Year not at home, but it was enjoyable. I was very happy. We went to High Street to count down to the New Year, then drank some alcohol in the office. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how so much food appeared because earlier I thought there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any, so I was planning to buy some. But then, food suddenly arrived! Haha, I realized that we often overthink and don&amp;rsquo;t trust the process. But I still believe in you. It&amp;rsquo;s a good way to start the year. Let&amp;rsquo;s achieve our goals one step at a time and make it a habit. I believe in you, we can do it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I want this post to be about our goals, so you, Raven from the future, make sure you do what it takes to achieve these goals. OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larger Salary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt-Free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become Truly Happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career Growth (make sure to become senior)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Active Again (lifting and jogging – it&amp;rsquo;s good for our health)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financially Literate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a Motorcycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A New Phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see our goals are clear. Make sure to make every day count so we can get closer to them. Life has already taught you the hardships and lessons; now it&amp;rsquo;s time for you to apply those lessons. If no one has told you this before, I believe in you. One day, we will look back at this and laugh about it. You will also find the one for sure – you are a good person, and the universe will unfold on its own. Don&amp;rsquo;t cling to the past, forgive them as you forgive yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I felt lazy to go to the office, so I worked from home. I need to change this habit since it’s not helpful for us. But you know, we need to feel stable first so we can move on to the next step. We should also get back to exercising—I&amp;rsquo;m feeling so bloated—and focus on our diet as well. Anyway, for sure we’ll get there. No pressure; take your time. Always remember to enjoy your life. And enjoyment doesn&amp;rsquo;t always mean going out and partying. Sometimes, it’s about staying at home, exploring the internet, learning new things, and playing games. Like I said, we are just simple people, so don&amp;rsquo;t listen to other people&amp;rsquo;s definitions of happiness—it’s not you. OK? Just remember, we’re doing well. Hope to see you again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Good morning! It&amp;rsquo;s Sunday, and we are currently at a stable stage. Hehe, I enjoyed the whole day of resting yesterday. We watched a movie and ate food. I hope it stays like this always. Anyways, it&amp;rsquo;s another day, and I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at 4:48 AM. I watched two movies—&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, which is a series. I fell asleep while watching, but I finished it. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice movie, and it teaches you that no matter what happens or what decisions you&amp;rsquo;ve made in the past, you can move forward and continue. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing well there, and let&amp;rsquo;s thank him for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:45 Am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unblocked someone and stalked a bit, hehe. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit strange to see someone who was once part of your life become a stranger. Haha, how did people overcome this before? Anyways, I know it&amp;rsquo;s not good to cling to your past, as it will only hinder your healing and moving forward. I hope you start prioritizing yourself, okay? Promise me that this year will be different. We will come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, it&amp;rsquo;s me again, you from the future, the one who is going to read this. I hope this marks the day that we surrender everything to Him. We can&amp;rsquo;t do it by ourselves; we&amp;rsquo;ve already proved that. Anyway, today is a happy day, and I need to be thankful for that as I want to practice gratitude. This will help us become content with everything. By the way, our phone is totally broken now, hahaha. Even when I charge it, it won&amp;rsquo;t turn on. But yeah, we still need to be thankful for everything. Hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing fine there. As of the moment, we are doing OK. We can do this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My body&amp;rsquo;s on the line now.&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t fight this time now.&lt;br&gt;
I can feel the light shine on my face.&lt;br&gt;
Did I disappoint you?&lt;br&gt;
Will they still let me over&lt;br&gt;
If I cross the line?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times did I try to cross the line? When should I learn? But I am still grateful to God that He still guides me and provides the things I need. Maybe I just need to persevere and hope for the best. I still thank You, God. Happy Birthday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
